**MQTT vs Kafka** â€” both are messaging systems, but theyâ€™re designed for *very* different use cases. Here's a breakdown to help clarify when to use which:

---

### âš¡ Quick Comparison:

| Feature | **MQTT** | **Apache Kafka** |
|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Protocol Type** | Lightweight messaging protocol | Distributed streaming platform |
| **Designed For** | IoT devices, constrained networks | High-throughput, large-scale data pipelines |
| **Message Model** | Pub/Sub | Pub/Sub + log-based storage |
| **Persistence** | Optional, often not used | Built-in, durable, distributed log |
| **QoS Levels** | 0 (at most once), 1 (at least once), 2 (exactly once) | At least once (default), exactly once (configurable) |
| **Broker Complexity** | Lightweight (e.g., Mosquitto) | Heavy (e.g., Kafka needs Zookeeper or KRaft) |
| **Latency** | Low | Low to medium, optimized for throughput |
| **Storage** | Minimal to none | Retains messages (configurable retention) |
| **Scalability** | Limited (single broker common) | Highly scalable and distributed |
| **Security** | TLS, username/password | TLS, SASL, ACLs, etc. |
| **Typical Use Cases** | IoT sensors, mobile devices, telemetry | Event sourcing, log aggregation, analytics pipelines |

### ðŸ§  TL;DR:

- **Use MQTT** when:
  - You have *resource-constrained devices* (IoT, edge computing).
  - You need *real-time* messaging over *unstable or low-bandwidth* networks.
  - You care about lightweight, battery-friendly communication.
  - Example: Smart thermostats sending temperature data every few seconds.

- **Use Kafka** when:
  - You need to handle *millions of events per second*.
  - You want to *persist messages* for replay, analytics, or audit trails.
  - Youâ€™re building *complex data pipelines* or *event-driven systems*.
  - Example: Website clickstream analysis, financial transaction processing.
